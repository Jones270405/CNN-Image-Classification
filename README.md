# Task 3: Image Classification using CNN  
**Machine Learning Internship – EliteTech**

---

## Overview
This project is part of **Task 3** of the **Machine Learning Internship at EliteTech**.  
The objective of this task is to build, train, and evaluate an **Image Classification model** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** CIFAR-10 Dataset  
- **Format:** Image Dataset  

### Description
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of images belonging to multiple categories and is widely used for benchmarking image classification models. Each image is represented as a small color image, making it suitable for CNN-based learning.

---

## Problem Statement
To implement a **CNN-based Image Classification model** that can learn spatial and visual patterns from image data and accurately classify images into predefined categories.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### Libraries
- `TensorFlow / Keras`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

---

## Workflow
1. Loaded and explored the CIFAR-10 dataset  
2. Performed image preprocessing and normalization  
3. Designed the CNN architecture  
4. Compiled the model using an appropriate loss function and optimizer  
5. Trained the CNN model on training data  
6. Evaluated the model on test data  
7. Analyzed model performance and documented results  

---

## Results
- The CNN model achieved **good accuracy** on the test dataset  
- The model successfully learned **spatial features** from images  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks** proved effective for image classification tasks
